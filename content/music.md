I make electronic music under the moniker Trope. You can find my music on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/trope), 
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0IOLSzCF8GhD2mkXW5zSKP), [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/to-return-again/id1143902574?uo=4&app=music&at=1001lry3&ct=dashboard), and [Bandcamp](https://musictrope.bandcamp.com/).

I primarily use FL Studio, although I have used Ableton Live quite a bit, too.
I like to play around with samples, often creating instruments out of samples I
found on the Internet or recorded myself.

I make music as a hobby, and I'm constantly learning! You can keep up with my music [here](/tags/music/).
